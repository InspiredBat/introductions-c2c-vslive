Hey, I'm Jordan Hariel!

I was born and raised in the Jackson, Mississippi area. I attended Hinds Community College, then transferred to Mississippi College to complete my Computer Science degree.

I'm now working as a Software Developer for BadgePass, Inc. and really loving it!

My hobbies include reading, writing sci-fi/fantasy, and tea collecting and sampling.
