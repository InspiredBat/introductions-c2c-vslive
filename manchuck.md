Charles Reeves. People call me Chuck, and my family calls me Chuckie. I'm a soon-to-be father in 2024. When my 👶 arrives, I won't have much time spending multiple days 🥾 backpacking and 🏕️ camping in the woods.

I am the Sr Javascript Developer advocate for [Vonage](https://developer.vonage.com/en/home). Working remotely out of New York, I help empower developers to build out cool shit.
